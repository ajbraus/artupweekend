          <p>
            NO! In fact, Artup Weekend was created by three people, an <strong>Entrepreneur</strong>, another an <strong>Artist</strong>, and a <strong>Maker</strong>. We think that the most amazing art, fun, and products come from mixing these three types of people.

            Sure! Pitch any idea you like for art or an art object. If it is saleable, great. Be sure to set expectations with your team so everyone is clear.

            Each set of city organizers develops their own set of prizes and possiblities for their Artup Weekend, so get in touch with your organizer, or if your thinking to become the organizer, start brainstorming what you could give away. We've seen a lot of things including cash prizes, gallery space, studio space, and surprises.

            Its easy and fun and can really boost your career (artistic or otherwise!). First, float the idea around to a few leaders who might want to join your team and a few venues. Once you have a team and a few ideas for venues, <%= link_to "fill out an application", new_event_application_path %> and we'll get back to you lickity-split.
